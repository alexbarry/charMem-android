# I wrote this file myself, using information from the book:
#	"Remembering Simplified Hanzi" by James Heisig
# Here's more information: 
# 	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi
# I don't want to include it because I didn't write it very well (only 
# intended using it for myself), and that would take away some 
# incentive from other people to buy the book.
# There's a free sample out there somewhere.

# In hindsight, it makes more sense to just ignore chars.txt,
# then reference that in my code. So both will compile and 
# run properly, but my local copy will have the full set of 
# characters while the published one does not.
